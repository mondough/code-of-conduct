*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to change in the future. Please get in touch (see 'Alerting us' below) if you‚Äôd like to suggest any changes.*

**The Monzo [Community Forum](https://community.monzo.com) and [Developers Slack](http://devslack.monzo.com/)** are places where Monzo users should feel welcome and included to share their opinions. And while we accept (and encourage) all manner of differing opinions, we also want to ensure people always feel safe üëç

The purpose of this document is to outline our community values - what we do, and don‚Äôt, stand for - and the measures we take to protect them.

# Inclusivity üôå

We want everyone to feel included in our community. In particular, nobody should ever feel excluded on the basis of their:

- Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
- Sexual orientation
- Disability or medical condition
- Physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- Race
- Age
- Religion

**A note on politics:** Political discussions are not banned, but we don't tolerate using our forum as a personal soapbox to air political opinions. As always, our moderators have the final say on this.

# Our Shared Values ‚òÄÔ∏è

**You agree that:**

- We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
- We have ***zero tolerance*** for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
- We respect people‚Äôs boundaries and identities.
- We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
- We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.
- We do not post anything that encourages or suggests ways of breaking the law, or the security measures of Monzo and other banks.

**We actively work towards:**

- Being a safe community.
- Cultivating a network of support and encouragement for each other.
- Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

**We condemn:**

- Stalking or publishing private information (‚Äòdoxxing)
- Threats of harm or harassment.
- Anything that compromises people‚Äôs safety.

# Forum Etiquette üìù

**We avoid:**

- Name-calling.
- Ad hominem attacks (criticising a poster personally, not their post).
- Responding to a post‚Äôs tone instead of its actual content.
- Replying in a confrontational manner when we see a post we think needs attention (use the flag feature to report it instead).
- Deliberately derailing threads, or other forms of trolling.
- Posting low-value content that doesn‚Äôt add to the discussion.
- Repeatedly making the same arguments, instead of moving on. Threads that end up going in circles will be locked.

**We‚Äôre polite and respectful:**

- Don‚Äôt post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
- Don‚Äôt post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
- Don‚Äôt harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
- Don‚Äôt post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

It‚Äôs best to avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you‚Äôre unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was shown to your boss, family, or friends. *When in doubt, avoid it*.

**When we‚Äôre called out, we:**

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips and help toward avoiding reoffending in the future.
- Apologise and ask forgiveness.

If the above is ever unclear, **final decisions are at the discretion of the moderation team (Community Leaders and staff, with staff having the ultimate say)**. They will use their best judgement to determine what is in the best interest of maintaining an inclusive community. **Just because something is not explicitly prohibited in this document, that doesn‚Äôt make it automatically ok**.

So please respect what they decide, and avoid nit-picking the rules if you disagree.

# Consequences for breaking the rules üö®

We take a strong stance on enforcing our community guidelines. In severe cases, such as posting content that we have zero tolerance on, we will immediately ban and remove the user from our community.

For other violations, we‚Äôll follow these steps -

**First offence:** we‚Äôll issue a formal warning, through the community or a Slack Direct Message.
Whenever a warning is issued, we will refer back to this document and indicate the part of the Code of Conduct we feel has been breached.

**Second offence:** a further warning will be issued, in stronger terms. Offenders will be reminded of the consequences of continuing to break the Code of Conduct - which can include suspension or removal from the Community.

**Third offence**: we will take an action. This can be a short-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour), a long-term suspension (for repeated misbehaviour on a large scale, or a significant incident), or outright removal from the Community forum and Slack channel (for extremely serious situations).

**For future offences,** if - following a suspension - the user returns and continues to be disruptive and act contrary to the above agreements, a full removal will be implemented without warning.

***tldr**; users receive two warnings (the second stronger), then an appropriate action, and following offences will result in removal.*
